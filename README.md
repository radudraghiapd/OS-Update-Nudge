# OS Update Nudge

The objective of this implementation is to promote user-initiated OS updates whenever they become available, eliminating the need for continuous IT intervention.

The scripts are being pushed via MDM and scheduled to execute daily at noon (according to the device's local time) to check for available updates.

In the event available updates are detected, a dialogue window appears, providing the user with the choice to either dismiss the notification or open the Update Manager to initiate the installation.

The aim of this daily notification is to be a gentle reminder rather than an intrusive interruption, motivating users to proactively address OS updates.
